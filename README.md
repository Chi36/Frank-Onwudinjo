Data Analytics
Delighted to announce that I have successfully completed an introductory course on the rudiments of data analysis despite my busy packed schedule.
DATA, DATA EVERYWHERE! #data #dataanalytics 

In the course of the MOOC, I was able to learn how to define and explain key concepts involved in data analytics including data, data analysis, and data ecosystem.
My reasoning skills got more sharpened as I understand how to conduct an analytical thinking self-assessment and giving specific examples of the application of analytical thinking.

The instructors also discussed the role of spreadsheets, query languages such SQL and data visualization tools (like tableau) in data analytics and described the role of a data analyst with specific reference to jobs/positions.

To sum, rather than depend on observation and intuition, data would be most reliable in making key decisions from gainful insights gleaned. 

This data journey continues...
